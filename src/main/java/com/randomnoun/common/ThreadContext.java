/**
 * Can probably do all this with ThreadLocals these days.
 * 
 * <p>Manages a set of hashmaps used by EJB/servlet containers to hold <b>thread-global</b> data.
 * 
 * <p>For example, calling <code>ThreadContext.get("asd")</code> from two different threads may
 * return two different values.
 *
 * <p>In addition, each thread is supplied with a stack context which allows multiple EJBs
 * to run in the same thread (e.g. if one EJB invokes another local EJB which then
 * executes within the same thread). To ensure separation of data, each EJB
 * should invoke {@link #push()} to create its own context as soon as
 * it is invoked, and call {@link #pop()} before it terminates to
 * maintain the per-thread data stack. (i.e. the invoked method, not the method caller is
 * responsible for maintaining data integrity).
 *
 * <p>This class has all the methods of {@link java.util.Map}, although these are
 * now static. A real thread-specific java.util.Map object can be obtained by
 * calling the {@link #getMap() getMap} method. Using this object rather than
 * calling static methods on ThreadContext directly may improve performance. The
 * map instance returned by getMap() is <b>not</b> synchronized, since it is
 * assumed that only one thread is accessing it's own context at the same time.
 *
 * <p>Each EJB (or thread) wishing to use this data structure should clean up after
 * itself by invoking ThreadContext.clear() before passing control back to the
 * EJB container (or terminating). Every thread MUST be removed using .pop(), otherwise
 * memory leaks will occur.
 *
 * <p>Implementation note: this class relies on different thread's returning unique
 * strings for their Thread.getName() method. It will break if this is not the
 * case in a particular VM implementation. 
 *
 * <p><b>NB:</b> Don't use this method to pass state between EJBs. 
 * Where an EJB invokes a second EJB, it should be
 * assumed that the invoked EJB exists on another VM. Since this data
 * structure will not be populated correctly on the second VM, it should not
 * be relied upon to pass state information between EJBs.
